The list of notebooks are:
- [Random Forests](https://github.com/Chi-EEE/Data_Science-Project/tree/main/Notebooks/Random-Forests){:target="_blank"}
- [Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/Chi-EEE/Data_Science-Project/tree/main/Notebooks/Support-Vector-Machine){:target="_blank"}
- [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/Chi-EEE/Data_Science-Project/tree/main/Notebooks/Na%C3%AFve-Bayes-Classifier)
- [K-Nearest Neighbours](https://github.com/Chi-EEE/Data_Science-Project/tree/main/Notebooks/K-Nearest-Neighbour){:target="_blank"}
- [K-Means](https://github.com/Chi-EEE/Data_Science-Project/tree/main/Notebooks/K-Means)
- [K-Nearest Neighbours Redone](https://github.com/Chi-EEE/Data_Science-Project/tree/main/Notebooks/K-Nearest-Neighbour-Two){:target="_blank"}

I have also made a minimalist webapp for [K-Nearest Neighbours](https://github.com/Chi-EEE/Data_Science-Project/tree/main/Notebooks/K-Nearest-Neighbour/deployment).  
To run the webapp, run the following commands in the deployment directory:
```bash
pip install flask pandas
flask run
```
